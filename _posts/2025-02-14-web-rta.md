## Overview

The CWL Web Red Team Analyst (WEB-RTA) exam is a practical web security assessment involving two vulnerable web applications.
The exam focuses on identifying and chaining multiple web vulnerabilities to achieve full compromise. It is fully hands-on and requires manual testing rather than relying on automated scanners.



### Vulnerabilities Covered

The WEB-RTA exam covers the following web vulnerabilities and attack concepts on training Labs:

- Reconnise
- SQL Injection (SQLi)  
- XML External Entity (XXE)  
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)  
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Authentication Bypass  
- Authorization Bypass  
- JWT Misconfiguration / Token Manipulation  
- OAuth Misconfiguration (Scope Abuse)  
- Weak Access Control  
- WAF Bypass Techniques  
- OTP Logic Flaw / Brute Force Weakness  
- Internal Service Exposure   
- Privilege Escalation  
- Multi-step Attack Chaining  


### Summary Flow

→ JWT Manipulation  
→ SQLi / XXE Discovery  
→ Credential Extraction  
→ OAuth Scope Abuse  

### Toolkit Used

- Burp Suite (Proxy, Repeater, Intruder)
- FFUF (for directory discovery)
- jwt.io (for token analysis)
- CyberChef (for decoding and data transformation)
- Manual Logic (Understanding the OAuth 2.0 Flow was more powerful than any script)


### Final

WEB-RTA is a structured, practical exam that tests real web exploitation skills. It requires solid fundamentals, patience, and the ability to connect multiple weaknesses into a single attack path.

It is suitable for learners who already understand core web vulnerabilities and want hands-on experience in chaining attacks across applications.
